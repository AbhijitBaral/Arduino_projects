Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots (.) and dashes (-) , or dits and dahs.
*Each Morse code symbol is formed by a sequence of dits and dahs. The dit duration can vary for signal clarity and operator skill, but for any one message, once established it is the basic unit of time measurement in Morse code. The duration of a dah is three times the duration of a dit (although some telegraphers deliberately exaggerate the length of a dah for clearer signalling)
*Each dit or dah within an encoded character is followed by a period of signal absence, called a space, equal to the dit duration. 
*The letters of a word are separated by a space of duration equal to three dits, and words are separated by a space equal to seven dits
